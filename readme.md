# Dotfile Configurations

1.  Bashrc

    My bashrc config complete with a bunch of useful aliases and color prompt setup. There are numerous files involved.

    -   [See files](./bashrc)

2.  Emacs

    My emacs config which is currently set up for org as well as Javascript & Python development.

    -   [Files & Readme](./emacs)
    -   [Config File](./emacs/.emacs)

3.  i3 Window Manager

    My config files for i3wm. Includes a custom lock screen and more. There are some dependencies, though. You can see them as executables in the config file. Uses i3blocks for status bar.

    -   [Files & Readme](./i3)

4.  Tmux

    My tmux configuration with some keybind changes (for Vim-like navigation) as well as theming.

    -   [Files & Readme](./tmux)
    -   [Config File](./tmux/.tmux.conf)

5.  Vim

    A vim setup for JS and Python development as well as a ton of themes. Packages are handled with vundle.

    -   [Files & Readme](./vim)
    -   [Config File](./vim/.vimrc)
