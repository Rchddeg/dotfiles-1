* My Vim Setup

If you clone this for your own use, know that it requires VIM 8.0+

1. Clone this repo into ~/.vim and symlink vimrc to your home folder.

#+BEGIN_SRC
git clone git@github.com:trev-dev/vim-setup.git ~/.vim
cd ~/.vim
ln -s ~/.vim/.vimrc ~/.vimrc
#+END_SRC

2. Run Vim and perform the :PluginInstall command
