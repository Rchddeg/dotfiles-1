# My bashrc setup.

Heavily borrowed from [Mathias Bynens](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles)

Backup your bashrc related files and copy all the dotfiles from here to your home directory. You may then copy all the bash dotfiles to your home and root-home directories.
```
cp .bash* ~/
(Repeat the same for root)
```
